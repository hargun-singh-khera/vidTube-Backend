# VidTube - Professional Backend Overview

## Introduction
This repository hosts the backend infrastructure for **VidTube**, a YouTube-like platform, providing robust functionality for user authentication, video management, commenting, and more. Designed for scalability and performance, this server efficiently handles key operations that power an engaging user experience.

## Prerequisites

npm install
```

## Running the Server
For development mode with hot-reloading and experimental JSON module support, use:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure
The backend follows a modular architecture for maintainability and scalability:
- **`src/`** – Core backend logic.
  - **`index.js`** – Main entry point of the server.
  - **`routes/`** – Defines API endpoints.
  - **`controllers/`** – Implements business logic for each route.
  - **`middlewares/`** – Custom middleware functions.
  - **`models/`** – Database schema definitions using Mongoose.
  - **`utils/`** – Reusable utility functions.

## Dependencies
The server leverages well-established libraries to ensure security, performance, and maintainability:
- **bcrypt** – Secure password hashing.
- **cloudinary** – Cloud-based media storage and delivery.
- **cookie-parser** – Enhances cookie handling for authentication.
- **cors** – Enables cross-origin requests.
- **dotenv** – Manages environment variables securely.
- **express** – Fast and flexible web framework.
- **jsonwebtoken** – JWT-based authentication.
- **mongoose** – Simplifies MongoDB interactions.
- **mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2** – Efficient pagination for large datasets.
- **multer** – Handles file uploads.
